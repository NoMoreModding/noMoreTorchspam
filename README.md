# No more Torch Spam

A small mod that adds the Glow Crystal, a scalable light source.
Have you ever wanted to light up a lager area?
Before this mod you would probably spam torches all over
but spam no more!
The glow crystal will save you :3

You can place up to 4 crystals at once to get the maximum light range!
